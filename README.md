# hybrid-dual-estimator

We provide an estimator by using the hybrid dual attack for all 5 LWE-based NIST candidates.
It includes 3 algorithm:
1. **dual**: the standard dual attack;
2. **HYBRID1**: the hybrid dual attack which guesses all possible vectors of the secret;
3. **HYBTID2M**: the hybrid dual attack with optimal pruning and efficient matrix multiplication.
